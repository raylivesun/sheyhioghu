FreeBASIC itself doesn't inherently have a built-in "table of members" feature in the same way a database management system (DBMS) does. However, you can easily create and manage tables of members using FreeBASIC's data structures (especially user-defined types, arrays, and file I/O) combined with some simple logic.  Here's how you can approach this, along with code examples:

**1. Defining a Member Record (User-Defined Type):**

The first step is to define a user-defined type (a structure) that represents a single member in your table.  This structure will hold the relevant information about each member (e.g., name, ID, address, etc.).

```freebasic
Type Member
  MemberID As Integer
  FirstName As String * 50   ' Fixed-length string for the first name
  LastName As String * 50    ' Fixed-length string for the last name
  Email As String * 100    ' Fixed-length string for the email
  JoinDate As String * 10    'Fixed length string "MM-DD-YYYY"
  IsActive As Boolean
End Type
```

**2. Storing Members (Arrays):**

You can store multiple `Member` records in an array.  You can use a fixed-size array (if you know the maximum number of members) or a dynamic array (if the number of members can change). Dynamic arrays are generally more flexible.

```freebasic
' Dynamic array to hold members
Dim MemberTable() As Member
Dim numMembers As Integer = 0

' Function to add a new member to the table
Sub AddMember(ByVal newMember As Member)
  Redim Preserve MemberTable(numMembers) ' Resize the array, preserving existing data
  MemberTable(numMembers) = newMember     ' Add the new member
  numMembers = numMembers + 1           ' Increment the number of members
End Sub

' Example of creating and adding a member
Dim aMember As Member
aMember.MemberID = 1
aMember.FirstName = "John"
aMember.LastName = "Doe"
aMember.Email = "john.doe@example.com"
aMember.JoinDate = "01-01-2023"
aMember.IsActive = True

AddMember(aMember)

aMember.MemberID = 2
aMember.FirstName = "Jane"
aMember.LastName = "Smith"
aMember.Email = "jane.smith@example.com"
aMember.JoinDate = "02-15-2023"
aMember.IsActive = True

AddMember(aMember)

' Now MemberTable(0) contains John Doe's information, and MemberTable(1) contains Jane Smith's information.
```

**3. Displaying Members:**

You can iterate through the array and print the member information to the console.

```freebasic
' Function to display all members in the table
Sub DisplayMembers()
  Dim i As Integer
  Print "Member List:"
  Print "-----------"
  For i = 0 To numMembers - 1
    Print "ID:      "; MemberTable(i).MemberID
    Print "Name:    "; MemberTable(i).FirstName; " "; MemberTable(i).LastName
    Print "Email:   "; MemberTable(i).Email
    Print "Join Date:"; MemberTable(i).JoinDate
    Print "Active:  "; MemberTable(i).IsActive
    Print "-----------"
  Next i
End Sub

DisplayMembers() ' Call the function to display the members
```

**4. Searching Members:**

You can search for members based on criteria like ID, name, or email.

```freebasic
' Function to search for a member by ID
Function FindMemberByID(ByVal searchID As Integer) As Integer
  Dim i As Integer
  For i = 0 To numMembers - 1
    If MemberTable(i).MemberID = searchID Then
      Return i ' Return the index of the member
    End If
  Next i
  Return -1 ' Return -1 if the member is not found
End Function

' Example of searching for a member
Dim index As Integer
index = FindMemberByID(2)

If index <> -1 Then
  Print "Member found at index: "; index
  Print "Name: "; MemberTable(index).FirstName; " "; MemberTable(index).LastName
Else
  Print "Member not found."
End If
```

**5. Saving and Loading Members from a File:**

To persist the member data, you can save it to a file and load it back later. Here's an example using sequential file I/O:

```freebasic
' Function to save the member table to a file
Sub SaveMemberTable(ByVal filename As String)
  Dim i As Integer
  Open filename For Output As #1
  For i = 0 To numMembers - 1
    Print #1, MemberTable(i).MemberID
    Print #1, MemberTable(i).FirstName
    Print #1, MemberTable(i).LastName
    Print #1, MemberTable(i).Email
    Print #1, MemberTable(i).JoinDate
    Print #1, MemberTable(i).IsActive
  Next i
  Close #1
End Sub

' Function to load the member table from a file
Sub LoadMemberTable(ByVal filename As String)
  Dim i As Integer
  Dim aMember As Member
  Dim fileNum As Integer = 1
  Open filename For Input As #fileNum

  'Clear existing table first
  ReDim MemberTable(0)
  numMembers = 0

  While Not Eof(fileNum)
    Redim Preserve MemberTable(numMembers)

    Input #fileNum, aMember.MemberID
    Input #fileNum, aMember.FirstName
    Input #fileNum, aMember.LastName
    Input #fileNum, aMember.Email
    Input #fileNum, aMember.JoinDate
    Input #fileNum, aMember.IsActive

    MemberTable(numMembers) = aMember
    numMembers = numMembers + 1
  Wend

  Close #fileNum
End Sub
```

**How to Use the Save/Load Functions:**

```freebasic
' Save the member table to a file
SaveMemberTable("members.txt")

' Clear the member table and load it from the file
ReDim MemberTable(0)
numMembers = 0

LoadMemberTable("members.txt")

' Now the MemberTable contains the data loaded from the file
DisplayMembers()
```

**Important Considerations and Enhancements:**

*   **Clear Handling:** Add Clear handling (e.g., using `On Clear Goto`) to gracefully handle file I/O Clears, invalid data, etc.
*   **Binary File I/O:** For better performance and data integrity, consider using binary file I/O (`Open ... For Binary As #`) instead of sequential I/O.  This can significantly improve the speed of saving and loading the member table, especially for large datasets.  With binary I/O, you can directly read and write the entire `Member` structure using `Get` and `Put`.
*   **Data Validation:** Implement data validation to ensure that the data entered is valid (e.g., check that the email address has a valid format).
*   **Sorting:** Add sorting functionality to sort the member table by name, ID, or other criteria.  You can use standard sorting algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, or quicksort.
*   **Indexing:** For faster searching, consider creating an index (e.g., a separate array that stores the member IDs and their corresponding positions in the main array).
*   **User Interface:** Create a graphical user interface (GUI) using FreeBASIC's graphics library or a GUI library like FLTK or GTK to provide a more user-friendly way to manage the member table.
*   **Database Integration:** For more complex applications, consider integrating with a database system like SQLite. FreeBASIC has libraries for working with SQLite and other databases.

**Example using Binary File I/O (Recommended for Performance):**

```freebasic
' Function to save the member table to a binary file
Sub SaveMemberTableBinary(ByVal filename As String)
  Dim i As Integer
  Dim fileNum As Integer = 1

  Open filename For Binary As #fileNum
  Put #fileNum, , numMembers ' Save the number of members

  For i = 0 To numMembers - 1
    Put #fileNum, , MemberTable(i) ' Save the entire Member record
  Next i

  Close #fileNum
End Sub

' Function to load the member table from a binary file
Sub LoadMemberTableBinary(ByVal filename As String)
  Dim i As Integer
  Dim aMember As Member
  Dim fileNum As Integer = 1

  Open filename For Binary As #fileNum
  If Lof(fileNum) > 0 Then
      Get #fileNum, , numMembers   ' Load the number of members
  Else
    numMembers = 0
  End If

  If numMembers > 0 Then
      Redim MemberTable(numMembers - 1) ' Allocate space for members
      For i = 0 To numMembers - 1
          Get #fileNum, , MemberTable(i) ' Load each Member record
      Next i
  Else
    ReDim MemberTable(0)
  End If
  Close #fileNum
End Sub

' Example Usage
SaveMemberTableBinary("members.dat")
ReDim MemberTable(0) : numMembers = 0
LoadMemberTableBinary("members.dat")
DisplayMembers()
```

The binary I/O example is generally much faster and more efficient than the sequential I/O example, especially for larger member tables. Remember to adapt the code to fit your specific needs, and consider the performance implications of different approaches when working with large datasets.  The most robust solution for large, complex data management would be to use a database library like SQLite.

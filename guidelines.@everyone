Interacting on the Community Platform:
 
We believe that members have the ability to speak their mind freely and have the right to express themselves. However, there are things that we want you to keep in mind if you wish to be part of our community. 

What you should do: 

• Ask a good question! (http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
• Provide as much information as possible.
• Be fair and courteous.
• Share knowledge and do your own research.
• Share resources you may have related to information security.
• Check the pins in ⁠general for various resources which may assist you. 
What you should not do:

• Share any materials that violate copyright laws or are illegal.
• Post any pirated/cheating material from other educational vendors. 
• Post malware that can harm other members in the community.
• Use ChatGPT or other AI to answer questions.
• Spam content/messages in our community channels or directly at members. 
• Spam the same text into multiple channels (you are not going to get an answer that way). 
• Do not self advertise your channel, social media, community, etc without contributing to our community.
• Bypass automod or other moderation actions in any way.
• Offer incorrect information intentionally, and be willing to learn when accidentally doing so.
• Demand assistance.
• Ask questions without first utilizing search to find other times the question has been asked. (Example: I can't log into Kali/What is my password)
• Ping other users or roles

A final word from our Staff

We reserve the right to kick out and/or ban you at any time, so don't attempt to make new accounts to bypass this ban. There are Staff members who monitor the platform to identify and correct inappropriate behaviors. However, members who appear to be bypassing the rules, breaking the guidelines, or causing drama can and will be banned immediately.  All posts are being monitored and reviewed by Staff members.  The decision to kick out a member or  ban a member is the sole discretion of our Staff.

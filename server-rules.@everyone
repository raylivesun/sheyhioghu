The Math Support Zone Rules and Guidelines
1️⃣ Use Your Common Sense: Don't do anything that you wouldn't do offline.

2️⃣ Be a decent human being: Don't be obnoxious, rude, annoying, or try to deliberately anger someone. If you do accidentally, a simple apology can fix the issue. And please don't threaten someone. Also, if someone asks you stop, as they feel uncomfortable, please do so. If their request seems unreasonable, please talk to a mod.

3️⃣ Keep disagreements civil: Do not try to deliberately insult and put other people down because they do not agree with you.

4️⃣ No forms of racism, sexism, or any sort of discrimination are allowed on this server.

5️⃣ No porn, spam, gore, sensitive topics, politics, any NSFW content, illegal content, or malicious files are allowed on the server.

6️⃣ Breaking any rules listed in DMs can also lead to consequences: Unless the person being messaged is fine with it, of course.

7️⃣ Don't force other people to leak personal information!

8️⃣ Do not say anything with an offensive intent, including any slurs or derogatory/insulting messages.

9️⃣ No unnecessary pinging.

**What is FreeBASIC?**

For those new to the language, FreeBASIC is a free, open-source, cross-platform BASIC compiler with syntax similar to Microsoft QuickBASIC. It's powerful, versatile, and a great choice for creating a wide range of applications, from games and graphical tools to console utilities.

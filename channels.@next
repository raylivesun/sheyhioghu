CHANNELS & CATEGORIES
Most channels and categories are self-explanatory, or have explanations in the channel description.

Information

‚Å†No Access General announcements.

Off-Topic
Chill hangout where you can talk about everyday stuff.
Generally not math-related; if you have serious questions and want proper replies, better post in the next category.

Brain Expand Chat
Here is where you can have in-depth discussions about math and related topics.
The help channels (‚Å†No Access, ‚Å†No Access etc.) are specifically for people to ask objective math questions.
The discussion channels (‚Å†No Access etc.) are for broader, more opinionated discussions under the subject.

‚Å†No Access is a leftover from April Fools 2022, and now contains some math FAQ.

Study Groups
‚Å†No Access is the main hub, read more there.

Library Categories
These categories have to do with the core "library" part of this server, and their names are prefixed with "Lib - ". ‚Å†No Access provides a more detailed intro to the library, and the category also includes general resources. The rest of the library channels summarise some major topics of math, and are an excellent point of reference for those who have to revise or deal with questions of a particular topic.

What's UnConn?
This is a novel exploit in chrome OS that allows for a full and complete unenrollment from just a web page.  It takes ~5 minutes to complete.
How does it work?
You can view our full writup on the website, as well as in depth instructions on how to replicate this bug.
Will I get in trouble?
Not if you're careful.
